<h1>Brawl Stars Statistics Page</h1>
<p>Website created with Django using the official Brawl Stars API</p>
<p>Site is not currently deployed due to lack of funding</p>

<h3>API Calls</h3>
<p>
  The API request class can be found in /bs_api_django_app/player_info/api<br>
  This file is taken directly from my <a href="https://github.com/dilliglobabgriz/BrawlStarsApi">BrawlStarsApi</a> repository, which includes testing and more in depth documentation.<br>
  Feel free to make use of or modify this repo if you are looking into the Brawl Stars API.
  All you need to do is update the <code>self.API_KEY</code> attribute, then use the call_api method to make your requests.<br>
